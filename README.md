Q2: Text-Driven Image Segmentation with SAM
Pipeline Description

The notebook q2.ipynb demonstrates text-prompted image segmentation using pre-trained models.

Workflow Steps

Text-to-Box:
Uses GroundingDINO to take a text prompt (e.g., “a dog”) and an image, generating bounding boxes for the described object.

Box-to-Mask:
The bounding boxes are passed as prompts to the Segment Anything Model (SAM).

Segmentation:
SAM produces a precise segmentation mask for the detected object.

Visualization:
The final mask is overlaid on the original image using the Supervision library.

Limitations

Mask quality depends heavily on the bounding boxes generated by GroundingDINO.
→ Vague prompts may lead to inaccurate results.

The current implementation supports only one object prompt per image.

Note on SAM 2

Although the assignment mentioned SAM 2, its limited public availability led to the use of the original and widely adopted Segment Anything Model (SAM) by Meta AI for this implementation.
